# Workshop data

This section shows the data and the data sources we'll us in the workshop.

## Natural Earth (`~/materials/natural_earth`)

The [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) dataset is a
free collection of vector and raster data published by the North American
Cartographic Information Society to encourage mapping. In this workshop we will
use the datasets `Cultural`, `Physical` and `Raster` in large scale (1:10m).

## OpenStreetMap (`~/materials/osm_mongolia`)

[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a free editable map database
of the world. In this workshop we use a small excerpt of the huge OSM
database focused on mongolia which is provided by the company geofabrik as a
collection of single [shapefiles](http://download.geofabrik.de/asia/mongolia-160101.shp.zip).
